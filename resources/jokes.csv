I know an introverted entrepreneur in the coal industry. He mined his own business.
"Sign above an Instagram entrepreneur's door:
""Carpe DM"""
"Why did the entrepreneur become a gardener?
Because they knew they could ""grow"" their business."
"I hear they have made a new artificially intelligent Oreo?
…...It's one smart cookie."
"I’m a walking economy, you know
How so?
My hairline is in recession, my stomach is always in inflation, and these two together bring me into a deep depression."
"My boss told me to stop acting like a flamingo, so I had to put my foot down."
"Why are artificial intelligences in movies always female?
Because they're never wrong."
People always talk about how great of an entrepreneur Elon Musk is but he's yet to create a cologne called Elon's Musk.
"Why did the entrepreneur decide to go into the landfill business?
He heard it was a growing field."
Why did the entrepreneur quit his job at the orange juice factory? Because he couldn't concentrate!
