            "I believe that the way we use language can lead to restructuring in our brains.\nLanguage is not just a tool for communication, but also a cognitive system that shapes how we think and perceive the world around us.\nThe way we use language influences our cognitive processes and affects how we process information.",
        "Language is a living thing that grows alongside the human and is unable to exist without consciousness.":
            "I agree that language is a living thing that grows alongside humans and is unable to exist without consciousness.\nLanguage is a dynamic and complex system that evolves and adapts to new situations and contexts as humans interact with it.\nWithout consciousness, language would not exist.",
        " Language is innate to the human being. It is something instinctual and does not require immense training to get.":
            "I believe that language is innate to the human being.\nHumans are born with a language acquisition device (LAD) that enables us to learn and understand language.\nLanguage acquisition is not just a matter of learning words and phrases, but also involves an innate ability to recognize and apply the grammatical rules that underlie language.\nWhile language acquisition may vary in speed and efficiency among individuals, the innate capacity for language acquisition is present in all humans"
